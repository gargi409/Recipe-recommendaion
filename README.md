# Recipe-recommendation

It is a food recipe recommendation system based on ingredients detection
using deep learning. A user has to input an image of raw ingredients, their age, height and weight, after which a platter is recommended to them based on their BMI. A CNN model was used for image classification and the user can see the name, ingredients and a picture of the dish predicted.
